# Synthetic-gaze-data-augmentation-for-improved-user-calibration
Model weights and network implementation to reproducibility of the paper "Synthetic gaze data augmentation for improved user calibration"


## Modules
We used Tensorflow as framework to build the architecture. Specifically, we used tensorflow.keras. 
An additional module necessary to build the model is the classification_models module, from which we used the pretrained Resnet-18 over imagenet. To install this module, please refer to:
